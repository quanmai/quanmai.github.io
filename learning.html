                                This does not mean they cannot explain things in technical details; rather, they can distill complex concepts into simpler, more relatable explainations.
                                Abstract thinking requires a deep understanding of the subject and the ability to simplify things.
                                Simplify difficult concepts is itself difficult. 
                                The deeper your understanding, the easier it becomes to break things down and communicate them clearly. Yet, I have found it challenging to do this myself.
                                Therefore, I write this page to practice my abstract thinking, hopefully I can learn things deeply and explain things clearly. -->
                                I realize that reading papers and materials is not enough to understand a subject deeply, writing things out, on the other hand, helps me to understand things better.
                                Putting into words what I have in mind helps clarify my thoughts and identify gaps in my understanding. 
                                This page is a collection of my thoughts on various topics, some might be taken from papers that I read,
                                some might be my own ideas, and some might be inspired by popcasts that I listened to. Read at your own risk (of being bored lol).

                                Notes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orDKvo8h71o">this lecture</a> by Hyung Won Chung.
                                Great lecture, I realize that I approached AI from a wrong perspective. I pay too much attention to details,
                                and I forget the big picture. That's possibly why I always have a hard time choosing a research direction, 
                                and always eventually end up with a direction that solves a small problem of AI. Who cares about papers
                                that just solve a specific problem in the age of LLMs? I did not advance the field! (atleast that's what I think).
                                My last 2 papers solve a problem of BERTs, now 
                                <a href="https://www.yitay.net/blog/model-architecture-blogpost-encoders-prefixlm-denoising">BERTs are deprecated</a>.
                                Okay, enough of my whining, let's get to the point.

                                AI is advancing so fast, new developments are coming out every day.
                                It is hard to keep up with all the latest papers and models.
                                When things are going too fast, all we need to do is study the change itself. 
                                We do not have time and energy to catch up with all the latest developments. We just need
                                to study the driving force behind the change.

                                Past 70 years of entire AI research can be summarized into developing progressively <b>more general method</b>
                                with <b>weaker modeling assumptions (inductive biases)</b>, and <b>add more data and compute</b> (scale up).

                                And that has been the recipe of entire AI research until now. Usually the more modeling assumptions, the less scalable the method is.
                                More human input means less degree of freedom for the model to learn.
                                An example of this is deep learning v.s. classical ML. Why is DL so much better than classical ML? It was more scalable.
                                Because it has less structure, less inductive bias, and more degree of freedom.
                                <br><br>
                                With compute becoming cheaper (faster than we are becoming better researchers), the strucure of the model is becoming less and less important.
                                That's why Decoder-only models (like ChatGPT, LLaMA, etc.) are so much better than Encoder-only models (like BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) 
                                because they are the least structured.

                            </p>
                            <br><br>

                                <p class="title"  >
                                    The less structure, the more scalable method is.
                                </p>
                            </blockquote>

                                So why don't we just use the least structured, end-to-end model? It's infeasible. Instead we should find
                                an "optimal" structure to add given the level of compute we have. In other words, we should find the most
                                end-to-end structure that just started to work. Later on, we should revisit the structures we added and remove those
                                that hinder scalability.

                            </p>
