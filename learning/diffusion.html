                                Let us think of a drop of ink
                                spreading into water. At first, the ink is concentrated, but as it <i>diffuses</i>, it spreads out
                                and becomes a uniform blur over time. If we could magically reverse this process, we could 
                                recover the original ink drop. <i>Diffusion</i>, in simple sense, is about spreading out 
                                due to random motion.

                                In computer science, specifically in machine learning, diffusion models 
                                are types of generative models that learn to reverse the process of <i>corruption</i>â€”
                                turning a noisy, disordered state into a structured, meaningful one. 
                                Denoising diffusion models<a href="#ref1" id="citation1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, at an abstract level, involve 
                                gradual transformation through structured randomness.
                            </p>


                            <h2>Destruction and Reconstruction</h2>
                            <p>
                                At its heart, diffusion models follow a broader principle:
                                <blockquote>A system can move from randomness to clarity if guilded by an intelligent process that 
                                    learns to undo disorder step by step.
                                </blockquote>
                                Denoising diffusion models comprise of two processes: <b>forward</b> and <b>reverse</b>. 
                                And we will use a metaphor of <i>sculpture</i> to have a better understanding of these processes.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Forward Process: Controlled Destruction</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The diffusion process gradually adds (Gaussian) <a rel="Website" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_noise" target="_blank">noise</a>  
                                    to data until the signal is destroyed, or until people say <q>what the heck did they do to you</q> (pardon my dry joke).
                                    This is analogous to taking a beautiful
                                    sculpture and gradually chipping away at it, here and there. At first, we can still see the shape,
                                    but as we keep chipping, it becomes more and more unrecognizable - eventually turning into a formless rock.
                                </p>
        
                            <h3>Reverse Process: Learning to Rebuild Step by Step</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The model learns how to reconstruct data by reversing noise addition at each step. 
                                    This mirrors a general principle:
                                    <blockquote>
                                        If you understand how disorder is introduced, you can learn how to remove it systematically.
                                    </blockquote>
                                    Now, if we are given this formless rock and asked to reconstruct the original sculpture, 
                                    we can't just <q>glue back</q> the lost pieces. Instead, we must <b>learn</b> the patterns
                                    of how sculptures are typically made and gradually refine the shape, step by step, until 
                                    something recognizable emerges.
                                </p>
                            
                            <h3>Why Can't We just Reverse Gaussion Noise</h3>
                            <p>
                                Some might ask, okay I am not lying, I asked myself this question too, 
                                <q>If noise is added in a well-defined way (like Gaussian noise), why can't we just reverse it directly?</q>
                                The answer lies in the <i>irreversibility</i> and <i>uncertainty</i> of the process.
                                <br>
                                <h4> Randomness in the Noise Process</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Even though Gaussian noise has a known distribution, at each step, the noise added is 
                                    <b>random</b> (stochastic). The artist doesn't know how the sculpture was chipped away - 
                                    only that the process follows a general pattern (the noise distribution), what
                                    is given is just the final formless rock.
                                    This means we don't just have a simple function that maps
                                    <q>noisy data -> clean data</q>. Instead, we need to learn the underlying distribution of
                                    the original data.
                                </p>
                                <h4>The Problem of Many-to-One Mapping</h4>
                                <p>
                                    At high noise level, many different images (or data points) can become nearly indistinguishable.
                                    because they all look like a random noise.
                                    There is no simple one-to-one mapping back to the
                                    original data. Instead, diffusion models <b>learns a probabilistic way</b> to gradually reconstruct
                                    the original data. This is like trying to guess the original sculpture from a rough rock. 
                                    The process of destruction removes fine details, making it hard to tell the original shape.
                                </p>
                                
                                Instead of direct inversion, diffusion models <i>learn</i> a <b>denoising function</b>
                                using a <span style="text-decoration: line-through; opacity: 0.5;">magical black-box</span> deep neural network.
                                This function predicts the original structure from the noisy data, step by step. It learns the probability
                                distribution of data, so the model can <q>guess</q> the right reconstruction rather just mathematically
                                reversing the Gaussion noise.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <blockquote class="box has-text-centered" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1rem; background: #b8d6d7; border-left: 4px #c4cedd;">
                                    It's not about <b>undoing</b> but about <b>reimagining</b> the structure in a way that makes sense!
                                </blockquote>
                                <br>
                                After the learning process, the model can generate new data by <b>conditioning</b> on the noisy data.
                                Thinking of it like an artist who has seen thousands of sculptures before. If you give them a block of marble,
                                with only some vague chisel marks left, they won't recreate the exact lost sculpture, but they can 
                                carve something that fits within the general style and structure of what they have learned.
                                Similarly, the diffusion models does not memorize the individual images, it learns the overall structure of
                                data so it can generate something <i>statistically likely</i> rather than an exact copy of the original.

                            </p>

                                Denoising diffusion isn't just about generating images - it reflects a general way of thinking about problem-solving:
