                        I am pursuing my PhD degree in Computer Engineering at University of Arkansas at Fayetteville,
                        working with <a rel="Website" href="http://www.csce.uark.edu/~sgauch/" target="_self">Dr. Susan Gauch</a>.
                        Since 2023, my research primarily focuses on natural language processing (NLP), particularly in neural information retrieval, 
                        where I design and implement neural frameworks to enhance the efficiency of information retrieval systems.
                        <br><br>
                        Before diving into NLP, I focused on high-performance computing, acclerating code on GPUs.
                        I was a Super-compute Architect Graduate Intern at <a rel="Website" href="https://intel.com" target="_blank">Intel</a> during Spring 2022.
                        And prior to graduate school, I worked as an IP Design Engineer at eSilicon (acquired by <a rel="Website" href="https://synopsys.com" target="_blank">Synopsys Inc.</a>),
                        particularly in transitor-level IC design and verification.
                        <br><br>
                        Programming and data structure was a challenge for me back then, I began practicing coding through projects like 
                        <a rel="Website" href="https://github.com/quanmai/pygame" target="_blank">pyGame</a> and 
                        and daily <a rel="Website" href="https://leetcode.com/quan_mai" target="_blank">leetcode</a> challenges.
                        <!-- Today, Python is my go-to language, although I also have experience in C++ and GPU programming with CUDA and DPC++. -->
                        And yes, I am approaching my 700th day of daily coding in this December!
