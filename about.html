                        I'm a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, advised by 
                        <a rel="Website" href="http://www.csce.uark.edu/~sgauch/" target="_self">Dr. Susan Gauch</a>.
                        Since 2023, my research has focused on NLP, specifically neural information retrieval, 
                        where I develop frameworks to improve retrieval efficiency.
                        <br><br>
                        Before NLP, I worked on high-performance computing and GPU acceleration, completing an internship as a 
                        Super-compute Architect at <a rel="Website" href="https://intel.com" target="_blank">Intel</a> in Spring 2022.
                        Prior to grad school, I was an IP Design Engineer at eSilicon (now <a rel="Website" href="https://synopsys.com" target="_blank">Synopsys</a>),
                        focusing on transistor-level ICs design and verification.
                        <br><br>
                        Programming was a challenge for me back then, I began practicing coding through projects like 
                        <a rel="Website" href="https://github.com/quanmai/pygame" target="_blank">pyGame</a> 
                        and daily <a rel="Website" href="https://leetcode.com/quan_mai" target="_blank">leetcode</a> challenges.
                        <!-- Today, Python is my go-to language, although I also have experience in C++ and GPU programming with CUDA and DPC++. -->
                        I will reach 1000 days of continously leet-coding soon!
