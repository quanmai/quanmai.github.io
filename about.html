                    I am pursuing my PhD degree in Computer Engineering at University of Arkansas at Fayettville.

                    <br>
                    I mainly work on machine learning, deep learning and high performance computing. 
                    I am currently working on Graph Represeantion Learning and its applications in Biomedicine and Natural Language Processing.

                    Previously, I was a Super-compute Architect Graduate Intern at <a rel="Website" href="https://intel.com" target="_blank">Intel Oregon</a>
                    (Spring 2022) and an IP Design Engineer at <a rel="Website" href="https://synopsys.com" target="_blank">Synopsys VietNam</a> (2016-2019).
                    <br><br>
                    I do not consider myself a naturally good programmer, I thereby practise coding as a hobby in my sparetime 
                    (e.g. <a rel="Website" href="https://github.com/quanmai/pygame" target="_blank">pyGame</a>,
                    and of course, <a rel="Website" href="https://leetcode.com/heyitsquanmai/" target="_blank">leetcode</a>).
                    Python is the language that I choose to have fun in, although I have done lots of projects in C++ 
                    and GPU programming languages (CUDA, DPC++).
