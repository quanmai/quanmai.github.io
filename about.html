                    <br>
                    I am pursuing my PhD degree in Computer Engineering at University of Arkansas at Fayetteville,
                    working with <a rel="Website" href="http://www.csce.uark.edu/~sgauch/" target="_self">Dr. Susan Gauch</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I mainly work on machine learning, deep learning and high performance computing. 
                    I am currently working on Graph Representation Learning and its applications in Natural Language Processing.

                    Previously, I was a Super-compute Architect Graduate Intern at <a rel="Website" href="https://intel.com" target="_blank">Intel Oregon</a>
                    (Spring 2022) and an IP Design Engineer at eSilicon (acquired by <a rel="Website" href="https://synopsys.com" target="_blank">Synopsys Inc.</a>) (2016-2019).
                    <br><br>
                    I used to be more into hardware stuff before grad school. Circuit design was my thing.  I was skilled at designing and optimizing ICs for speed and power efficiency.
                    But when it came to programming and data structures, let's just say I had a bit of a rough time. So, I've been tinkering with coding in my free time.
                    (e.g., <a rel="Website" href="https://github.com/quanmai/pygame" target="_blank">pyGame</a>
                    and daily <a rel="Website" href="https://leetcode.com/quan_mai" target="_blank">leetcode</a> challenge).
                    Python is the language that I choose to have fun in, although I have done lots of projects in C++ 
                    and GPU programming languages (CUDA, DPC++).
